                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>I learned about how important it is to include elements that show the user what they clicked on for a more engaging and clear experience.
                                Having a lot of cool transition effects when scrolling or swiping horizontally also makes the interface feel smooth and visually exciting.
                                I also learned how varying the degree of which elements move relative to each other makes the interface look more rich.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>I like how it includes examples from both phone apps and websites because it makes it easier for me to analyze how interface space management differs between the platforms. 
                                Having the interactions with the interfaces in gifs also makes it easy for me to understand the animation styles and transitions these interfaces used.
                                Linking the designs right below also makes it easier for me to check out the designer's other works and learn from those as well.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>I really like the design in: easygrow.io app preview by Edmond Vasar. The horizontal scrolling experience looks amazing on it, and I enjoy how the fruits smoothly transition from one to another.
                                Having a pull up tab at the bottom also saves space on the interface and makes things less cluttered. There are also icons beside the features (water temp, pH, etc.), which makes it very clear and engaging.</p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> I would rate it a 10/10, I really like how engaging the website is. As a more visual learner, the website was very helpful and appealing.</p>
