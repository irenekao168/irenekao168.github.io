					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned about how important is it for UX/UI designers to maintain a moral code, as they hold the power to influence users' actions and beliefs.
							I also learned about various dark patterns, such as Bait and Switch, Friend Spam, Hidden Costs, Roach Motel, and Sneak into Basket.
							Most of the dark patterns seem to be intended to trick users into spending money, clicking on advertisements, making it difficult for users to completely leave the website, or spreading false news. 
						</p>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>I really like how the author found example websites for every single type of dark pattern, as it really helped me understand the tactics more thoroughly.
						   The personal stories about how they were subject to certain tactics also made the issue of dark patterns seem more relevant and urgent.
						   I also really enjoy how much time the article goes into establishing that dark tactics are a deliberate choice and strongly holds the designers accountable for this behavior.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p>"I believe that as user experience designers we need to think beyond providing aesthetics and usability to our users. We help shape the lives of people everywhere and our decisions can have significant impacts on the way we as a society behave."</p>
					</li>
