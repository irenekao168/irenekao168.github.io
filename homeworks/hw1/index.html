<em>Data Science, Junior</em>
<p>Hello! I'm currently a full time struggling student, and in my free time I like to do digital art, play games, go on food escapades, or binge shows.
As an introvert I hardly leave my house, but when I do I enjoy hiking and sightseeing wtih my family.
I'm super new to the world of web design, and I'm looking forward to learning lots this semester!</p>

    <li>I learned how important it is to design a webpage according to your audience's needs and what they primarily use it for. I also learned about
        how placing things strategically on the webpage could help guide your audience to look at elements that you want them to see.</li>
    <li>One of my favorite aspects of this article is how it provides gifs and images to demonstrate their points clearly. I also really like how they
        listed their observations in bullet points, making it easy for me to engage in what they're talking about.</li>
    <li>"Who are the people using this product? How might their use cases be different from yours? How does the design serve these use cases?"</li>
    <li>I give this article a 10, I found it to be a very informative read.</li>
