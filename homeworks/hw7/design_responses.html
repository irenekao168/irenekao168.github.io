							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned about a few Gestalt principles and how they can be applied in making a better organized and clear user interface. 
								Gestalt principles are based on 4 essential principles: people generally identify things by their general form, people can use their memory to fill in gaps, different individuals view objects differently, and that people can view things from different perspectives.
								Some of the principles that help show grouping relationship between elements include: proximity, common region, similarity, symmetry, continuation, etc.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I really like the usage of images to demonstrate the overall concept of each Gestalt principle and how they can be utilized in crafting an interface. 
								Learning about principles like proximity and common region were also interesting, since I use these principles regularly in designs, but I haven't really considered why I do.
								I also really like how certain key terms were bolded in the first paragraph of the article, as it was very helpful in securing the key aspects of  what the author wanted to express.
