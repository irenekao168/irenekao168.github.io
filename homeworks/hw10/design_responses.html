							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p>I enjoyed learning about how psychology and UI design tie in together and how important it is to design around keeping the audience's focus on elements you want to draw them to.
								The cocktail party effect was interesting, as I subconsciouly use it in design a frequently, but didn't have a name or clear psychological explanation for it.
								I also found it intriguing how Hick's Law shows that choices actually relate to time logarithmically. Lastly, I had a lot of fun reading about how there are a variety of attention types
								and how we could use design to incite different attention types in the audience.
