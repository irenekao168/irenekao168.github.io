							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned about the concept of easing, which involves accelerating and deceleration of an animation to vary the speed of the animation and make it look more natural.
								Linear motion is generally better for animating objects that do not change positions, while using an ease in or ease out curve to animate animations that change positions is better for drawing attention to parts of the animation and engaging with users.
								Some examples of animation choreographies include equal interaction and subordinate interaction, and they differ in the sense that equal interaction often serves to direct an audience's attention in a linear way based on one rule and subordinate focuses on drawing attention to the main aspect of 
								the interface while still including the other subordinate elements.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really enjoyed how there were so many gifs to demonstrate the concepts the article was talking about, as it made it easier for me to visually understand their arguments for how a certain animation technique would make the audience feel.
								The clear labeling of what is a "good" and "bad" animation with both word labels and color coding (blue, red) was also super helpful for me to envision the article's points. 
								Lastly, I enjoy the clear divisions between concepts using typography and spacing, as it's clear to tell where the article begins talking about the major concepts (Easing, Choreography) and where it talks about the subdivision topics of the main topics (equal interaction, linear motion).

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>Imitating the behavior of objects from the real world we can create a sequence that allows users to understand what to expect from the interface.
