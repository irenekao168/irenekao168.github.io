							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned how important it is to make sure aspects of your website, such as color scheme, iconography, textures, etc. enable your website to be accessible for all audiences, including those who have impairements (eg: visually or cognitively). 
								Some tips mentioned include using colors in a way that increases contrast for visual clarity, using icons or messages to highlight important system information, or using textures to allow colorblind people to understand graphs/visuals despite not being able to see color accurately.
								Lastly I learned that if I'm working on a website with a team, it's important to create a color scheme key to make sure everyone on the team knows which colors are more accessible and better for usage.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I really like how much emphasis the author put on making sure the website's intentions are very clear to all users. 
								For example, I really like the section talking about using textures to help colorblind people, because it's a very fitting solution and something I don't usually see on the websites I visit. 
								The part talking about using clear icons to indicate error messages is also something that I personally resonate with, because a lot of websites don't do a great job telling me that I either entered information incorrectly or am trying to access something that is invalid.
